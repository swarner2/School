# School
This is a simple application so that a latin teacher can create simple web application that will be thrown into iframes for a system they use that their schools.

This is meant to be simple in structure and technology so there is no need for a dev team to maintain it.
There is no SPA as this will create a higher barrer to editing and creating new content.

This will have a simple node server that servers up directories from the app folder. Inside the app folder there are folder dividing the different iframes the teacher is needing.
