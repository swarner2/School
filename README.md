# School
This is a simple application so that a latin teacher can create simple web application that will be thrown into iframes for a system they use that their schools.

This is meant to be simple in structure and technology so there is no need for a dev team to maintain it.
There is no SPA as this will create a higher barrer to editing and creating new content.

This will have a simple node server that servers up directories from the app folder. Inside the app folder there are folder dividing the different iframes the teacher is needing.

The key to this project is the KISS rule with both sturcture as well as well as the technology being used.

The Server itself is just a static file server that gives off anything in the client folder.
